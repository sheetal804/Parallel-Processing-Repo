prog >outfile
will write the standard output to outfile instead. If pipes are supported,
prog | anotherprog
puts the standard output of prog into the standard input of anotherprog .
Output produced by printf also finds its way to the standard output. Calls to putchar and
printf may be interleaved - output happens in the order in which the calls are made.
Each source file that refers to an input/output library function must contain the line
#include <stdio.h>
before the first reference. When the name is bracketed by < and > a search is made for the
header in a standard set of places (for example, on UNIX systems, typically in the directory
/usr/include ).
Many programs read only one input stream and write only one output stream; for such
programs, input and output with getchar , putchar , and printf may be entirely adequate,
and is certainly enough to get started. This is particularly true if redirection is used to connect
the output of one program to the input of the next. For example, consider the program lower ,
which converts its input to lower case:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
main() /* lower: convert input to lower case*/
